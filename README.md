My first try with unity game engine and C# language.
My idea was to create a 2.5D combat game. We would move with our character only to sides, jump or crouch. There would be mix-ups of "light" and "heavy" attacks called combos. To make things more interesting I thought about various skills with different mana-usage and impact on battle. Character skills with greater impact would 'freeze' time and perform an animation and skills with lesser impact would just act as an extension of our combos.
